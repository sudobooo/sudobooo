### Hey!

My name's Serge.<br>
I'm a software developer. I write in Python and Ruby.

<br>
<br>

I worked at inSales, a company that makes online stores for small businesses. The service is similar to Shopify.
I helped to make a Telegram bot to organize the internal work of the company. I also took part in the finalization of the ticket system for technical support.

Before that, I studied for a Python developer at online school Hexlet. I have 4 projects.
- [The game](https://github.com/sudobooo/brain-games) tests a gamerâ€™s basic mathematical knowledge.
- [The program](https://github.com/sudobooo/python-project-lvl2) compares two files and finds a difference. It supports JSON and YAML formats.
- [The page loader](https://github.com/sudobooo/python-project-lvl3) saves an HTML page and its resources from the Internet.
- [Task Manager](https://github.com/sudobooo/python-project-lvl4) is an app that can be used by a few people at the same time. Registration and authentication are implemented. Tasks have a creator, executor, status, and a label.
